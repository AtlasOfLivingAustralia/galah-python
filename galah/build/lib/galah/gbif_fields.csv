Parameter,Description

eventDate,"Occurrence date in ISO 8601 format: yyyy, yyyy-MM, yyyy-MM-dd, or MM-dd. Supports range queries."
eventId,An identifier for the information associated with a sampling event.
facet,"A facet name used to retrieve the most frequent values for a field. Facets are allowed for all the parameters except for: eventDate, geometry, lastInterpreted, locality, organismId, stateProvince, waterBody.  This parameter may by repeated to request multiple facets, as in this example /occurrence/search?facet=datasetKey&facet=basisOfRecord&limit=0"
facetMincount,"Used in combination with the facet parameter. Set facetMincount={#} to exclude facets with a count less than {#}, e.g. /search?facet=type&limit=0&facetMincount=10000 only shows the type value 'OCCURRENCE' because 'CHECKLIST' and 'METADATA' have counts less than 10000."
facetMultiselect,"Used in combination with the facet parameter. Set facetMultiselect=true to still return counts for values that are not currently filtered, e.g. /search?facet=type&limit=0&type=CHECKLIST&facetMultiselect=true still shows type values 'OCCURRENCE' and 'METADATA' even though type is being filtered by type=CHECKLIST"

geometry,"Searches for occurrences inside a polygon described in Well Known Text (WKT) format. Only POINT, LINESTRING, LINEARRING, POLYGON and MULTIPOLYGON are accepted WKT types. For example, a shape written as POLYGON ((30.1 10.1, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30.1 10.1)) would be queried as is, i.e. /occurrence/search?geometry=POLYGON((30.1 10.1, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30.1 10.1)). Polygons must have anticlockwise ordering of points, or will give unpredictable results. (A clockwise polygon represents the opposite area: the Earth's surface with a 'hole' in it. Such queries are not supported.)"
hasCoordinate,Limits searches to occurrence records which contain a value in both latitude and longitude (i.e. hasCoordinate=true limits to occurrence records with coordinate values and hasCoordinate=false limits to occurrence records without coordinate values).
hasGeospatialIssue,"Includes/excludes occurrence records which contain spatial issues (as determined in our record interpretation), i.e. hasGeospatialIssue=true returns only those records with spatial issues while hasGeospatialIssue=false includes only records without spatial issues. The absence of this parameter returns any record with or without spatial issues."
hl,"Set hl=true to highlight terms matching the query when in fulltext search fields. The highlight will be an emphasis tag of class 'gbifH1' e.g. /search?q=plant&hl=true. Fulltext search fields include: title, keyword, country, publishing country, publishing organization title, hosting organization title, and description. One additional full text field is searched which includes information from metadata documents, but the text of this field is not returned in the response."

samplingProtocol,"The name of, reference to, or description of the method or protocol used during a sampling event"
scientificName,"A scientific name from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search. Under the hood a call to the species match service is done first to retrieve a taxonKey. Only unique scientific names will return results, homonyms (many monomials) return nothing! Consider to use the taxonKey parameter instead and the species match service directly"
source,"Source of a download, for example, GBIF-portal, python, etc."

subgenusKey,Subgenus classification key.
taxonId,The taxon identifier provided to GBIF by the data publisher.
taxonKey,"A taxon key from the GBIF backbone. All included and synonym taxa are included in the search, so a search for aves with taxonKey=212 (i.e. /occurrence/search?taxonKey=212) will match all birds, no matter which species."
toDate,"End partial date of a date range, accepts the format yyyy-MM, for example: 2019-12"
typeStatus,"Nomenclatural type (type status, typified scientific name, publication) applied to the subject."
